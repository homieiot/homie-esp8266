Removing functionality can become useful if your firmware gets too large in size and is not upgradable any more over OTA. On the other hand these compiler flags allow to remove features from homie-esp8266, that you do not require or do not use. Adding functionality or features is useful to enable only partly implemented features or unstable or experimental features. HOMIE_CONFIG This compiler flag allows to disable the configuration mode completely. To configure your homie-esp8266, you need to upload the configuration to the SPIFFS before starting the device. Without a proper configuration the device will just restart after writing the error message about the missing configuration to the logger. Add the following to your platformio.ini file: build_flags = -D HOMIE_CONFIG=0 This reduces the firmware size by about 50000 bytes. HOMIE_MDNS This compiler flag allows to disable the publishing of the device identifier via mDNS protocol. Add the following to your platformio.ini file: build_flags = -D HOMIE_MDNS=0 This reduces the firmware size by about 6400 bytes. ASYNC_TCP_SSL_ENABLED This compiler flag allows to use SSL encryption for MQTT connections. All other network connections still can not be encrypted like HTTP or OTA. build_flags = -D ASYNC_TCP_SSL_ENABLED=1 -D PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_LWIP2_HIGHER_BANDWIDTH The additional flag PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_LWIP2_HIGHER_BANDWITH is necessary for SSL encryptions to work properly.","title":"Compiler-Flags"},{"location":"advanced-usage/custom-settings/","text":"Homie for ESP8266 lets you implement custom settings that can be set from the JSON configuration file and the Configuration API.

Otherwise you get an error on startup if there is also no value configured in JSON configuration file. An HomieSetting instance can be of the following types: Type Value bool true or false long An integer from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 double A floating number that can fit into a real64_t const char* Any string By default, a setting is mandatory (you have to set it in the configuration file). If you give it a default value with setDefaultValue() , the setting becomes optional. You can validate a setting by giving a validator function to setValidator() . To get the setting from your code, use get() . To get whether the value returned is the optional one or the one provided, use wasProvided() .

These restrictions can be lifted (see next pages). To use Homie for ESP8266, you will need: An ESP8266 The Arduino IDE for ESP8266 (version 2.3.0 minimum) Basic knowledge of the Arduino environment (upload a sketch, import libraries, ...) To understand the Homie convention Installing Homie for ESP8266 \u00b6 There are two ways to install Homie for ESP8266. 1a. For the Arduino IDE \u00b6 There is a YouTube video with instructions: How to install Homie libraries on Arduino IDE Download the release corresponding to this documentation version Load the .zip with Sketch \u2192 Include Library \u2192 Add .ZIP Library Homie for ESP8266 has 5 dependencies: ArduinoJson >= 5.0.8 Bounce2 ESPAsyncTCP >= c8ed544 AsyncMqttClient ESPAsyncWebServer Some of them are available through the Arduino IDE, with Sketch \u2192 Include Library \u2192 Manage Libraries . For the others, install it by downloading the .zip on GitHub. 1b. With PlatformIO \u00b6 In a terminal, run platformio lib install 555 . Not yet released as stable The above command is for when the v2 is stable and released. Currently, the latest stable version is 1.5. In the meantime, use the develop branch to get started with the v2, add this in your platformio.ini : lib_deps = git+https://github.com/homieiot/homie-esp8266.git#develop Dependencies are installed automatically. Bare minimum sketch \u00b6 #include <Homie.h> void setup () { Serial . begin ( 115200 ); Serial << endl << endl ; Homie_setFirmware ( \"bare-minimum\" , \"1.0.0\" ); // The underscore is not a typo! See Magic bytes Homie . setup (); } void loop () { Homie . loop (); } This is the bare minimum needed for Homie for ESP8266 to work correctly. LED If you upload this sketch, you will notice the LED of the ESP8266 will light on. This is because you are in configuration mode. Homie for ESP8266 has 3 modes of operation: By default, the configuration mode is the initial one. It spawns an AP and an HTTP webserver exposing a JSON API. To interact with it, you have to connect to the AP. Then, an HTTP client can get the list of available Wi-Fi networks and send the configuration (like the Wi-Fi SSID, the Wi-Fi password, some settings...). Once the device receives the credentials, it boots into normal mode. The normal mode is the mode the device will be most of the time. It connects to the Wi-Fi, to the MQTT, it sends initial informations to the Homie server (like the local IP, the version of the firmware currently running...) and it subscribes to the needed MQTT topics. It automatically reconnects to the Wi-Fi and the MQTT when the connection is lost. It also handle the OTA. The device can return to configuration mode in different ways (press of a button or custom function, see Resetting ). The standalone mode. See Standalone mode . Warning As a rule of thumb, never block the device with blocking code for more than 50ms or so. Otherwise, you may very probably experience unexpected behaviors. Connecting to the AP and configuring the device \u00b6 Homie for ESP8266 has spawned a secure AP named Homie-xxxxxxxxxxxx , like Homie-c631f278df44 . Connect to it. Hardware device ID This c631f278df44 ID is unique to each device, and you cannot change it (this is actually the MAC address of the station mode). If you flash a new sketch, this ID won't change. Once connected, the webserver is available at http://192.168.123.1 . Every domain name is resolved by the built-in DNS server to this address. You can then configure the device using the HTTP JSON API . When the device receives its configuration, it will reboot into normal mode. Understanding what happens in normal mode \u00b6 Visual codes \u00b6 When the device boots in normal mode, it will start blinking: LED Slowly when connecting to the Wi-Fi LED Faster when connecting to the MQTT broker This way, you can have a quick feedback on what's going on. If both connections are established, the LED will stay off. Note the device will also blink during the automatic reconnection, if the connection to the Wi-Fi or the MQTT broker is lost. Under the hood \u00b6 Although the sketch looks like it does not do anything, it actually does quite a lot: It automatically connects to the Wi-Fi and MQTT broker. No more network boilerplate code It exposes the Homie device on MQTT (as <base topic>/<device ID> , e.g. homie/c631f278df44 ) It subscribes to the special OTA and configuration topics, automatically flashing a sketch if available or updating the configuration It checks for a button press on the ESP8266, to return to configuration mode Creating an useful sketch \u00b6 Now that we understand how Homie for ESP8266 works, let's create an useful sketch. We want to create a smart light. LightOnOff.ino Alright, step by step: We create a node with an ID of light , and name Light and a type of switch with HomieNode lightNode(\"light\", \"Light\", \"switch\") We set the name and the version of the firmware with Homie_setFirmware(\"awesome-light\" ,\"1.0.0\"); We want our light node to advertise an on property, which is settable. We do that with lightNode.advertise(\"on\").settable(lightOnHandler); . The lightOnHandler function will be called when the value of this property is changed In the lightOnHandler function, we want to update the state of the light node. We do this with lightNode.setProperty(\"on\").send(\"true\"); In about thirty SLOC, we have achieved to create a smart light, without any hard-coded credentials, with automatic reconnection in case of network failure, and with OTA support. Not bad, right? Creating a sensor node \u00b6 In the previous example sketch, we were reacting to property changes. But what if we want, for example, to send a temperature every 5 minutes? We could do this in the Arduino loop() function. But then, we would have to check if we are in normal mode, and we would have to ensure the network connection is up before being able to send anything. Boring. Fortunately, Homie for ESP8266 provides an easy way to do that. TemperatureSensor.ino The only new things here are the Homie.setSetupFunction(setupHandler); and Homie.setLoopFunction(loopHandler); calls. The setup function will be called once, when the device is in normal mode and the network connection is up. The loop function will be called everytime, when the device is in normal mode and the network connection is up. This provides a nice level of abstraction. Now that you understand the basic usage of Homie for ESP8266, you can head on to the next pages to learn about more powerful features like input handlers, the event system and custom settings.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"quickstart/getting-started/#installing-homie-for-esp8266","text":"There are two ways to install Homie for ESP8266.","title":"Installing Homie for ESP8266"},{"location":"quickstart/getting-started/#1a-for-the-arduino-ide","text":"There is a YouTube video with instructions: How to install Homie libraries on Arduino IDE Download the release corresponding to this documentation version Load the .zip with Sketch \u2192 Include Library \u2192 Add .ZIP Library Homie for ESP8266 has 5 dependencies: ArduinoJson >= 5.0.8 Bounce2 ESPAsyncTCP >= c8ed544 AsyncMqttClient ESPAsyncWebServer Some of them are available through the Arduino IDE, with Sketch \u2192 Include Library \u2192 Manage Libraries .
