# OTA

Homie for ESP8266 supports OTA, if enabled in the configuration, and if a compatible OTA server is set up.

It works this way:

1. The device receives an OTA notification from the MQTT broker, as defined in the Homie convention. If the version sent by the broker is different from the one set with `Homie.setFirmware()`, and if OTA is enabled in the configuration, the device will be flagged to reboot to `OTA` mode as soon as the device will be resettable (with `Homie.setResettable()`).
2. The device boots in `OTA` mode
3. The device reaches the OTA server and attempt to flash the new firmware
4. If the OTA fails or succeed, the device reboots to `normal` mode

## Creating a compatible OTA server

In `OTA` mode, the device sends a request to the host/path set in the configuration. This request contains the following headers:

- `User-Agent`: `ESP8266-http-Update`
- `x-ESP8266-free-space`: space available on the ESP8266 in bytes
- `x-ESP8266-version`: `Device ID`=`Firmware name`=`Firmware version`=`OTA version target` (e.g. `c631f278=awesome-light=1.0.0=1.1.0`)

Your server has to parse these headers. Based on the `x-ESP8266-version` header, it should decide what firmware it should send to the device. If no firmware is found, or if the firmware is bigger than the `x-ESP8266-free-space` header content, you can abort the OTA by sending a response with a `304` error code. To actually send the firmware, you must transfer the firmware file with a `200` code. For more bulletproof updates, you can also provide in the response the MD5 of your firmware file, in the `x-MD5` header.

You have an example PHP in the [Arduino for ESP8266 doc](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.1.0/doc/ota_updates/ota_updates.html#http-server) and a Node.js example in the [homie-server project](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-server/blob/7b53ee9a1e5a053d311da139da8df8d3bdfd6f98/lib/servers/ota.js#L126).

## Other OTA server projects

### homie-ota

* [homie-ota](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) is written in Python. It provides an OTA server for Homie devices as well as a simple _inventory_ which can be useful to keep track of Homie devices. [homie-ota](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) also enables you to trigger an OTA update (over MQTT, using the Homie convention) from within its inventory. New firmware can be uploaded to `homie-ota` which detects firmware name (`fwname`) and version (`fwversion`) from the uploaded binary blob, thanks to an idea and code contributed by Marvin.
