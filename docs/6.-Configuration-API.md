# Configuration API

When in `configuration` mode, the device exposes a JSON API to send the configuration to it. When you send a valid configuration to the `/config` endpoint, the configuration file is stored in the file system at `/homie/config.json`.

If you don't want to mess with JSON, you have a Web UI / app available:
* At [http://marvinroger.github.io/homie-esp8266](http://marvinroger.github.io/homie-esp8266)
* As an [Android app](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1906578/share)

**Quick instructions to use the Web UI / app**:

1. Open the Web UI / app
2. Disconnect from your current Wi-Fi AP, and connect to the `Homie-xxxxxxxx` AP spawned in `configuration` mode
3. Follow the instructions

You can see the sources of the Web UI [here](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/tree/configurator) and the built version [here](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/tree/gh-pages)

Alternatively, you can use this curl command to send the config to the device:

```
curl -X PUT http://homie.config/config --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d @config.json
```

This will send the `./config.json` file to the device.

## Error handling

When everything went fine, a `200 OK` HTTP code is returned.
If anything goes wrong, a return code != 200 will be returned, with a JSON `error` field indicating the error.

## API endpoints

#### GET `/heart`

This is useful to ensure we are connected to the device AP.

##### Response

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{ "heart": "beat" }
```

#### GET `/device-info`

Get some information on the device.

##### Response

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{
  "device_id": "52a8fa5d",
  "homie_version": "1.0.0",
  "firmware": {
    "name": "awesome-device",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "light",
      "type": "light"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GET `/networks`

Retrieve the Wi-Fi networks the device can see.

##### Response

* In case of success:

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{
  "networks": [
    { "ssid": "Network_2", "rssi": -82, "encryption": "wep" },
    { "ssid": "Network_1", "rssi": -57, "encryption": "wpa" },
    { "ssid": "Network_3", "rssi": -65, "encryption": "wpa2" },
    { "ssid": "Network_5", "rssi": -94, "encryption": "none" },
    { "ssid": "Network_4", "rssi": -89, "encryption": "auto" }
  ]
}
```

* In case the initial Wi-Fi scan is not finished on the device:

503 Service Unavailable (application/json)

```json
{"error": "Initial Wi-Fi scan not finished yet"}
```

#### PUT `/config`

Save the config to the device.

##### Request body

(application/json)

See [JSON configuration file](5.-JSON-configuration-file.md).

##### Response

* In case of success:

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{ "success": true }
```

* In case of error in the payload:

400 Bad Request (application/json)

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "Reason why the payload is invalid" }
```

* In case the device already received a valid configuration and is waiting for reboot:

403 Forbidden (application/json)

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "Device already configured" }
```


#### POST `/wifi-connect`

Initiates the connection of the device to the wifi network while in config mode. This request is not synchronous and the result (wifi connected or not) must be obtained by "/wifi-status".

##### Request params

ssid - wifi ssid network name

password - wifi password

##### Response

* In case of success:

202 Accepted (application/json)

```json
{ "success": true }
```

* In case of error in the payload:

400 Bad Request (application/json)

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "[Reason why the payload is invalid]" }
```


#### GET `/wifi-status`

Returns the current wifi connection status.

Helpful when monitoring Wifi connectivity after sending ssid/password and waiting for an answer.

##### Request params

None

##### Response

* In case of success:

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{ "status": "[status of wifi connection]" }
```



#### POST `/proxy-control`

Enable/disable the device to act as a transparent proxy between AP and Station networks.

All requests that don't collide with existing api paths will be bridged to the destination according to the "Host" header in http. The destination host is called using the existing Wifi connection (Station Mode established after ssid/password is configured in "/wifi-connect") and all contents are bridged back to the connection made to the AP side.

This feature can be used to help captive portals to perform cloud api calls during device enrollment using the esp wifi ap connection without having to patch the Homie firmware. By using the transparent proxy, all operations can be performed by the custom javascript running on the browser (/data/homie/ui_bundle.gz)

https is not supported.

Important: The http request and responses must be kept as small as possible because all contents are transported using ram memory, which is very limited.

##### Request params

enable - true or false indicating if the device has to bridge all unknown requests to the Internet (transparent proxy activated) or not.

##### Response

* In case of success:

200 OK (application/json)

```json
{ "message": "[proxy-enabled|proxy-disabled]" }
```
