# SSL support

In Homie for ESP8266 v1.x, SSL was possible but it was not reliable. Due to the asynchronous nature of the v2.x, SSL is not available anymore.

# ADC readings

[This is a known esp8266/Arduino issue](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/1634) that polling `analogRead()` too frequently forces the Wi-Fi to disconnect. As a workaround, don't poll the ADC more than one time every 3ms.

# Wi-Fi connection

If you encouter any issues with the Wi-Fi, try changing the flash size build parameter, or try to erase the flash. See [#158](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/issues/158) for more information.
